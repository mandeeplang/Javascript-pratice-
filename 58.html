        /* NULLISH COALESCING OPERATOR "??"
        The nullish coalescing operator is written AS TWO question marks??
        As it treat null and undefined similarly, we'll use a special term here, in this article. for brevity, we'll say that a value is defined when it's neither null or undefined.
        The result of a??b is:
        for Instance:*/
        let a =12,b,c;
        c=a??b;
       // document.write(a,);// In this command the result will be 12 , because if a is defined , then it will print a and if a is not defined then it will print b.
        // also if both the variables a and b are not defined then it will print undefined as the result.
        // if both the  values are defined then it will print the a as a result.
        let p=null;
        let s=11;
        let x=13;
       // document.write(p??s??x);// here it will again print the a value as a reuslt.
        document.write(p??s??x);// In this when the first value is null then, it will print the second value which is 11.
        // we can also write as result=(a! == null && a! == undefined)? a:b;
