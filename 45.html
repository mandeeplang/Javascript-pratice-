      //there's a special rule. these two are a"sweet couple".they equal each other(in the sense of ==),but not any other value.
      alert(null==undefined);//true
      // now let's see some funny things that happen when we apply these rules. and, what's more important, how to not fall into a trap with them.
      // strange result:null vs 0
      alert(null>0);//false
      alert(null==0);//false
      alert(null>=0); //true 
      /* mathematically, that's strange. the last result states that"null" is greater than or equal to zero
      so in one of the comparisons above it must be true, but they are both false.
       The reason is that an equlity check == and comparisons ><>=<= work differently.
       comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0. that's why(3)null>=0 is true and null>0 is false.
