    // Undefined value:
    // the special value undefined also stand apart. it make a type of its own just like null.
    // the meaning of undefined is "value not assigned"
    //if the variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then its value is undefined.:
    let name;
    alert(name);
    // technically its possible to assign " undefined " to a variable;
    let age = 100;
    // change the value to undefined
    age= undefined;
    alert(age);// undefined.
    // but they don't recommed doing that. normally, one uses null to assign an empty or undefined value to a variable  , while undefined is reserved as a defaultt initial value for unassigned things.
