        It is the simplest one. It happens in logical opertaions (later we'll meet condition tests and other similar things ) but 
     can also be performed explicitly with a call to boolean value .
     The conversion rules:
     1. values that are intuitively "empty", lik 0, an empty string, null, undefined, and Nan becomes false.
     2. other values becomes true.
