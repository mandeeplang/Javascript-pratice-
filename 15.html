        //uppercase constant:- some words are difficult to understand , so that's the reason why we are using the uppercase constant.

    const COLOR_RED="#FOO";
    const COLOR_GREEN="#F0";
    const COLOR_BLUE= "#00F";
    let color=COLOR_GREEN;
    alert(COLOR_GREEN);
    // benefits:-
    //1. being a constant just means that a variable's value will never be change. but some constants are known before exceution (like a hexadecimal value for green).
