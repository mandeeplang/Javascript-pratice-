        //alert(""+1+2);// string concatenation because the "" it consider as an empty string and then after it shows the result as 12.
       // alert(""-1+0);//-1
       // alert(true+false);// because true consider as 1 and false consider as 0 so basically when we add both 1+0 it will give us 1.
        //alert(6/"3");//2 when the string value is divide by any operator it will give you the result.
    
       // alert("2"*"3");//6 same a string value is * by any string value give you the result.
       // alert(4+5+"px");// 9pxthe numeric contatenations
       // alert("$"+4+5);//$45 because of string contatenation 
        //alert("4"-2);2 because string value - with any number will give you the result.
        //alert("4px"-2);//NAN this is not a number because the string value is 4px and the numberic value is 2 when it gets subtracted it will  give you the result as NAN ,its is an compuational error.
        //alert("-9"+5);//-95 string contatenation 
        alert("-9"-5);// in this case the -- will get add and the result will be -14 string will give result of all other operators expect + operator.
        alert(null+1);//1 the null value is 0 in it, so therefore 0+1 is always 1.
        alert(undefined+1);// NAN this will you  as NAN as a result because the undefined value gets add with any number will always give NAN.

        alert("\t\n"-2); //-2 this answer is -2 because this is a-operator so the first value is evaualted and throw away and then the result is -2.
