        /*STRING comparison:
        to see whether a string is greater than oanother, javascript uses the so called "dictionary " or "lexicographical " order
        In other words, strings are compared letter by-letter.
        The algorithum to compare two strings is simple:
        1. compare the first character of both strings.
        2. if the first character from the first string is greater (or less ) than the other string  
        3. otherwise, if both string's first characters the same, compare the second character the same way.
        4. Repeat until the end of either string.
        5. if both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. otherwise, the longer string is greater.
        for examples:*/
        alert('Z'>'A');//true Z comes after A that why the statement is true.
        alert('Bee'>'Be')//true because of Bee the length is greater than be
        alert('Glow'>'Glee');// true because the Gl is same in both and after the third character of glow is greater than glee.
        // For instance, A capital letter"A" is not equal to"a" because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding table of javascript uses (unicode).          </script>
