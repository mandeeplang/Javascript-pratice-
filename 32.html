        //Basic operators, maths:
        //term "unary", "binary,"operand".
        // an operator is unary if it has a single operand. for example:
        let x= 1;
        x=-x;
        alert(x);//-1
        // An operator is binary if it has two operands. thr same minus exists in binary form as well.
        let y=1;
        let z=3;
        alert(z-y);
        /* MATHS:
        The following math operations are supported:
        Addition+
        suvstraction-
        Multiplication *
        Division /
        Remainder(Modolus)%
        Exponentation **...
        Remainder and exponentation these both are the expectional cases, shown as below:
        */
       alert(5%2);//1
       alert(8%3);//2
       alert(8%4);//0
       // Exponentitation **
       // the exponentation opertor a ** b raises a to the power of b.
       // For instance;
       alert(2**2);//4
       alert(2**3);//8
       alert(2**4);//16
// just like maths, exponentation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well
alert(4**(1/3));//2
alert (8**(1/3));//2
