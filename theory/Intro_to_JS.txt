Introduction :

JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java. All the errors in the javascript, we can see them on the console. 

Javascripts virtual machine (acts like a operting system )

 Javascripts are not only execute in the browser, but also for the The Virtual machine are as follows:
1. V8- Opera, Edge,chorme 
2. spidermonkey- Firefox
3. Chakra for IE and etc.

Modern Javascript:

Javascripts program can be inserted in the HTML document anywhere in between the <Script> tag </scripts>
<script type=..> this type of tag was used before in the HTML4 Which required to scripts to have a type 
<script language>this tag used to explain the language of the javascript, but nowadays javascript has its own 
default lanaguage.

External Scripts :

<script src="alert.js" or "./alert.css">
</script>
This the example of external script, when we have alot of javascript code, then we can create a new file to put some code in that file and after that we use the external script to attached that code. 

Semicolon :

We need to use the semicolon at the end of the alert function for an example alert ("hello world");
but for some cases when we started the new line we don't need to put the semicolon for an example
alert("2+
3+
1");
 
 The modern use of "Use strict"
